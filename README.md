Semidefinite Programming for Chance Constrained Optimization


**Description:**

Chance Constrained Optimization:

max_x E[f(x,q)]\
s.t.\
Prob( q: p_j(x,q)>0, j=1,...l ) >= 1- Delta, 

where "x" is a decision vector,  "q" is a random vector with given probability distribution, and f and p_j are polynomials. 

**These are working notes and codes and will be updated.**
